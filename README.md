## About

This repo is the pair to jeff-heals-server in that it consumes from the Keystone.js/prisma backend (as well as a separate private react component library) to render content dynamically on the frontend. I believe the base for the CustomRenderer.tsx logic came from one of the official Keystone.js repos. You can read more about the website development here https://www.vesslio.com/services/website.

## Future

I don't think there is a high chance of this repo being updated in the future. Maybe if I start seeing a massive use case for graphql/apollo over supabase/react-query which is what I've been using recently.
